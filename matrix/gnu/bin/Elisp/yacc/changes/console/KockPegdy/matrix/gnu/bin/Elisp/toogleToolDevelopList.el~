This commands handles `defvar', `defcustom' and `defface' the
same way that `eval-defun' does.  See the doc string of that
function for details.

Normally, this function truncates long output according to the
value of the variables `eval-expression-print-length' and
`eval-expression-print-level'.  With a prefix argument of zero,
however, there is no such truncation.
Integer values are printed in several formats (decimal, octal,
and hexadecimal).  When the prefix argument is -1 or the value
doesn't exceed `eval-expression-print-maximum-character', an
integer value is also printed as a character of that codepoint.
